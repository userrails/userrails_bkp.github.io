Loop is the process in which set of instructions or block of codes are repeated in a specified number of times under certain condition is satisfied. for, while, do while are example of loops.

#### while loop
Ruby while loop is used to execute a program until condition is true, once condition fails execution is terminated from loop. While loop is used when number of needed iterations is not fixed.

```
count = 0

while count < 5 do
  p count
  count = count+1
end
```

#### do while loop

```
# syntax

loop do
  # some code here
  break if <condition>
end

# Example

i = 1
while true
  puts i
  i = i + 1
  break if i > 5
end

i = 1
loop do
  puts i
  i = i + 1
  break if i > 5
end

```


#### for loop
for loop is used to run block of code in a specific number of times when number of needed iterations is known.

```
for num in 1..100
  puts num
end 
```

#### Range loop
Ruby each method is used to iterator over individual item in an array.

```
(1..100).each do |num|
  puts num
end

# loop through an array using each
[1, 2, 3].each do |i|
  puts i
end

# loop through hash using each
hash_var = {name: 'Car', color: 'Red', model: '2018'}
hash_var.each do |key, value|
  puts "#{key} => #{value}"
end

# find index in loop using each_with_index

[10, 11, 12].each_with_index do |val, key|
  p key
end
=> 0
   1
   2
```

#### Times loop

```
5.times {|i| puts "number #{i}"}
```


# skip iterations with the next keyword

```
10.times do |i|
  res = i % 2
  next unless res==0

  puts i
end
```

# stop a loop early using break

```
arr = [2,4,6,8,10,12]
arr.each do |el|
  break if el > 10
  puts el
end
```
